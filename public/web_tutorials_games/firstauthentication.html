            <h2>1- Add a users table (we will call it player) and create the REST endpoints for authentication</h2>
            <p> Add a new table to the database (you can create a new database or add the table to the database you are
                using).
                This table will hold our user login and profile information (we could separate them further).
                We will call the table "player", since we will only consider players for now:
            </p>
            <code><pre class="code">
        create table player (
        	ply_id serial,
            ply_name VARCHAR(60),
            ply_passwd VARCHAR(60),
            primary key(ply_id)
        )
        insert into player (ply_name,ply_passwd) values ('John','Doe')
    </pre></code>
            <p> We will need to create three functionalities for authentication: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>login</strong> It will be a post, since we will register that the player as logged in.
                    It will receive the username and password and, if they match, register the login.</li>
                <li> <strong>get profile</strong> It will return information about the player if the player is logged
                    in.
                    Otherwise it will say that the player is not logged. Information like passwords will never be sent,
                    all password verifications
                    or similar must be done inside the server/database.
                </li>
                <li> <strong>logout</strong> It is also a post, since we will remove the login status.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> We will have a new REST resource for players and three new endpoints:</p>

                        otherwise,
                        since the id was saved by the server in the cookie, it should be a valid id.
                        You could consider it a 500 error if it depends on something that is not available for the
                        client to do.

            <h3> For these functionalities we will need to use Cookies </h3>
            <p> Cookies are another way to send information between client and server, specially on stateless servers
                where
                no information about the client is saved. They are usefull for authentication since they will be saved
                on the client
                side, and automatically sent to the server. </p>
            <p> On the client side the cookie is on a file, with information about the data that was saved and the
                site/page that created it.
                Each time the client makes a request to the server of the cookie the cookie information is sent.
            </p>
            <p> On the server we can also save information on the cookie, on the result that will be
                sent to the client. When the client gets the result it will save that information on the cookie.
            </p>
            <p> You can edit or see cookies on the client side using javascript, but we will not need to. </p>
            <p> Cookies created on the server side can be marked to not be editable by the client javascript, but it is
                still
                possible to see the value. However, if we sign the information, it will not be readable by the client,
                and anything
                that the client writes that was not signed can be ignored.
            </p>
            <p> In Node.js/Express.js we have 3 functionalies that will allow us to manage cookies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>cookie-parser</strong> This module automatically parses any cookie received and creates an
                    attribute value pair
                    that will be saved in one of two objects:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Signed cookies will be saved in "req.signedCookies" (ex: userId attribute will be acessible
                            using
                            "req.signedCookies.userId")</li>
                        <li> Unsigned cookies will be saved in "req.cookies"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> The module is installed by default using the express-generator and two lines are placed on
                        app.js to
                        configure the module:
                    </p>
                    <code><pre class="code">
                var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
                ...
                app.use(cookieParser()); </pre></code>
                    <p> If you will use signed cookies you will need to define a secret when calling cookieParser(). For
                        example:</p>
                    <code><pre class="code"> app.use(cookieParser('VERY SECRET SECRET')); </pre></code>
                </li>
                <li><strong>res.cookie(_name_, _value_ [, _options_ ]) </strong>
                    This is an express function that will create a new cookie with the given name and value
                    or set the value to an existing one.
                    The options define settings like expiration and signing. The code bellow creates a signed cookie
                    with name "userId"
                    value 1 and with the 1 hour expiration. It also marks the cookie to not be accessible to client side
                    javascript.
                    <code><pre class="code">
    res.cookie("userId", 1, {  maxAge: 60*60*1000,  httpOnly: true, signed:true});</pre></code>
                    <p> You can see the documentation <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.cookie">here</a>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>res.clearCookie(_name_ [, _options_]) </strong>
                    This is an express function that will delete the cookie with the given name.
                    The options must be equal to the ones that created the cookie except for expiration.
                    Bellow you can see the code to delete the cookie we created before
                    <code><pre class="code">
    res.clearCookie("userId", {  httpOnly: true, signed:true});
    </pre></code>
                    <p> You can see the documentation <a
                            href="https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.clearCookie">here</a> </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="color:red"> BELLOW HERE IT IS STILL ON CONSTRUCTION (mostly references to the code that will be explained on classes)</h2>
            <p style="color:red"> The tutorial will be finished (need more time)</p>
            
            <h3> Creating our authentication functions and endpoints </h3>
            <p> Authentication will be used on the player resources but it is a good idea to separate
                the functionalty that will work with the authentication cookies from the functionalities That
                will retrieve information from the database.
            </p>
            <p> Inside the models folder create the file <strong>authentication.js</strong>.
                You can find the code <a href="./files/authentication.js">here</a></p>
            <p> After that you can create the model (code <a href="./files/playersModel.js">here</a> ) 
                and routes (code <a href="./files/playersRoutes.js">here</a>).</p>
            <p> Finally you need to connect the new routes to the app by placing the following lines in app.js:</p>
            <code><pre class="code">
                var usersRouter = require('./routes/playersRoutes');
                app.use('/api/users', usersRouter);</pre></code>
            <p> You can actually edit the lines for the "old" users route, and delete the "user.js" file from the routes folder, 
                we are not using it anymore. </p>
           
            <p><strong> Test the endpoints you created using Postman</strong></p>
           
                <h3> The client side </h3>
            <p> For the client side you need to rename the "index.html" file to "game.html".
                The "index.html" will now be our login page. </p>
            <p> Code for the new <strong>index.html</strong> <a href="./files/newindex.html.txt">here</a></p>
            <p> Code for the new request javascript file (create file <strong>userRequests.js</strong> on requests folder)
                 <a href="./files/userRequests.js">here</a> </p>
            <p> Code for the new authentication javascript (create the folder authentication inside the javascript folder
                and create file <strong>authentication.js</strong> inside that) <a href="./files/authentication.js">here</a>
            </p>
            <p> When authenticated the <strong>rooms.html</strong> is called. You will need to create this page.
            You can see the code <a href="./files/rooms.html.txt">here</a>.
         This html uses the general style of the site, but has also specific rules. For those rules you need to
        create the <strong>rooms.css</strong> file in the stylesheets folder. You can see the code for that file 
    <a href="./files/rooms.css">here</a></p>
            <p>The rooms.html also needs some javascript</p>
            <p> First we need to create a general file that will manage the login sessions.
                Create the  <strong>session.js</strong>) inside the authentication folder. 
                This file will have a function 
                to get the profile information and a logout function. 
                Profile information is only available if the player
                is logged, otherwise it will redirect to the login page.</p>
            <p> You can see the code for the session.js <a href="./files/session.js">here</a>.</p>
            <p> We will also need to create the <strong>rooms.js</strong> file in the javascripts folder with the code bellow:</p>     
            <code><pre class="code">
                window.onload = async function() {
                    let userInfo = await getUserInfo();
                    document.getElementById("username").innerHTML = userInfo.ply_name;   
                }</pre></code>
            <p>For now this will only check if we are logged and show the name of the user and a link to the game.
                If we are not logged it will show a popup and send the user to the login page.
                Next we will let the user choose the room on this page, but we need to introduce a new concept for that
            </p>    
            <p> <strong> You can try the website now. The game itself does not check for login, but we can add that later.</strong></p>
            <h3> Choosing the room</h3>
            <p> For this functionality we need the concept of Web Storage. Web Storage is another way to 
                save information on the browser, but unlike cookies, the information is only accessible in 
                the client-side. You can use sessionStorage, that will run until the tab/browser is closed, or localStorage
                that will persist in the same computer.</p>
                <p> You can learn more about Web Storage <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp">here</a></p>
            <p> Change the code on the <strong>rooms.js</strong> file to the code <a href="./files/rooms.js">here</a></p>
            <p> Now the id of the room will be saved in sessionStorage and we can use it to play the game on that room</p>
            <p> On the <strong>gamelib.js</strong> file delete the line: </p>
            <code><pre class="code">const room = 1;</pre></code>
            <p> On the javascripts folder create a new file called <strong>game.js</strong> with the code 
            <a href="./files/game.js">here</a>. This will check if a room exists and set the room id that will be used on the gamelib.js file.</p>
            <p> We will need to change the HTML to include the new javascripts. We can also
                include the changes to have the username (and login check) on the page like we did for the rooms page.</p> 
            <p> See the code for the new HTML for the <strong>game.html</strong> 
                <a href="./files/newgame.html.txt">here</a> (replace the previous
            code for this new one).</p>
