      <h2>1- Change our database  so that the rules for the game are on the database </h2>
    <p> The new database version will allow us to have the rules of the game inside. It now has two tables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> A table that defines the valid values for cards and the card that looses againts those. 
            This table can be used to get the possible card values and check if a card wins agains the top card of the room.</li>
        <li> The room table that now instead of the top card value has the identifier that corresponds to one of the possible
            values on the card table.
        </li> 
    </ul>
      <p>Lets replace the old database for this new one. 
          First you will need to either create a new database or clear the previous one. 
        Then you can create the new version 
        of the database running the commands on these scripts: <a href="./files/RPS22-creates-v20.sql"> creation script</a> and 
    <a href="./files/RPS22-inserts-v20.sql">populate script</a>.</p>
    <p> Now we will need to change our models to adapt to the new changes. 
        We will change them in a way that will return and receive the same information.
        If we treat the model as black box, and keep the same interface, we do not need to change 
        neither the routes nor the client-side</p>
    <p>Let's start with the model functions for the "get" endpoints:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p> On the <strong>getAllRooms</strong> function change the value of the variable "sql" to: </p>
            <code><pre>
                let sql = `Select roo_id,roo_name, crd_name as roo_topcard 
                from room, card where roo_topcard_id = crd_id`;</pre></code>
            <p> Since the name of the card is on the "card" table we need to join the two tables in the query.
                We also need to filter only the columns we had before and change the name of 
                the column "crd_name" to "roo_topcard" so that what is returned is equal to what we had before.
            </p>
            <p> We used `` insteaf of "" to be able to write strings in more than one line (it would not work with "")</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <p>For the function <strong>getRoomById</strong> you will do the same and change the value of the  variable "sql" to</p>
            <code><pre>
                let sql = `Select roo_id,roo_name, crd_name as roo_topcard 
               from room, card where roo_topcard_id = crd_id and roo_id = $1`;</pre></code>
            <p> The only difference is that in this case we will have the filter by room id, like we had before.</p>
        </li>
        <li> <p> Finally for the function <strong>getRoomByNameOrTopCard</strong> you will need to change three strings:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> <p>You need to change the initial sql string to:</p>
            <code><pre>
                let sql = `Select roo_id,roo_name, crd_name as roo_topcard 
                from room, card where roo_topcard_id = crd_id`</pre></code> </li>
            <li><p> Inside the "if(parameters.name)" change the append to the sql string to:</p>
                <code><pre>
                    sql += ` and roo_name ILIKE $${nparam}`;</pre></code>
                <p> We added the "and" since we already have a comparison on the where clause. 
                    We also changed from LIKE to ILIKE, to make the comparison case insensitive.
                    ILIKE is not standard of sql but exists on Postgres 
                    (see <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/functions-matching.html">here</a>
                     if you want to know more).
                </p></li>
            <li><p>Inside the "if(parameters.topcard)" remove the "if" that adds the "and" (now we always need to have an "and")
                and change the append to the sql string to:</p>
                <code><pre>
                    sql += ` and crd_name ILIKE $${nparam}`;</pre></code></li>
        </ol></li>
    </ul>
    <p> If now you restart you server and go to your client it will not be working yet, 
        not even the visualization of the topcard that only depends on what we already changed. 
        The reason for this is that in the boardManager we used lower case names for the cards and
        in the database the first letter is in caps.
    </p>
    <p> This is actually something that we said we were doing wrong, the variable with those values, and the "beats" variable in the model, should not exist.
        Those values should be obtained from the database, and since we now have a card table, we can have an endpoint to get those values.
    </p>
    <p> Create a <strong>"cardsModel.js"</strong> file and place the code to obtain all the card information from the database:</p>
    <code><pre class="code">
var pool = require('./connection.js')

module.exports.getAllCards = async function () {
    try {
      let sql = `Select * from card`;
      let result = await pool.query(sql);
      let cards = result.rows;
      return { status: 200, result: cards };
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
      return { status: 500, result: err };
    }
  }</pre></code>
  <p>It is very similar to what we had for the rooms. Now create a <strong> "cardsRoutes.js"</strong> file and place the
      code for creating an endpoint to obtain all the card values:
  </p> 
  <code><pre class="code">
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var cModel = require("../models/cardsModel");
            
router.get('/', async function(req, res, next) {
    console.log("Get all cars")
    let result = await cModel.getAllCards();
    res.status(result.status).send(result.result);
});

module.exports = router;</pre></code>
<p> We are not done yet. We still need to connect this new route to our app. 
    Go to the <strong>"app.js"</strong> file and add 
    these two new lines next to the other similar lines:
</p>
<code><pre class="code">
    var cardsRouter = require('./routes/cardsRoutes');
    app.use('/api/cards',cardsRouter);</pre></code>
<p> Now restart the server and if you call the new endpoint (localhost:3000/api/cards) it will return all the 
    cards information.
</p>    
<p> If you do not want all the columns you can define what columns you want on your select and even give other names 
    instead of using *, like we have done previously.</p>
 <p> With this new endpoint we can change the client to use this information instead of the fixed
     array of values. This way we will never have this problem if there are some adjustments in the card names.
 </p>
 <p> First we need to create the <strong>"cardRequests.js"</strong> file on the requests directory with the following code to 
     retrieve the cards from our new endpoint:</p> 
     <code><pre class="code">
        async function getCards() {
            try {
                const response = await fetch(`/api/cards`);
                if (response.status == 200) {
                   var cards = await response.json();
                   return cards;
                } else {
                    // Treat errors like 404 here
                    console.log(response);
                }
            } catch (err) {
                // Treat 500 errors here
                console.log(err);
            }
        }</pre></code>
    <p> We also need to inclunde that file in the scripts of our <strong>index.html</strong> file:</p>
    <code><pre class="code">
        ...
        &lt;script src="./javascripts/renderers/board.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="./javascripts/requests/cardRequests.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;script src="./javascripts/requests/roomRequests.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        ...</pre></code>
    <p> Then, in the <strong>boardManager.js</strong> file we will need to make two changes:</p>
    <p> 1- Instead of a constant <strong>"const playValues=..."</strong> we will now have a variable
    with an empty list that will be filled later using the new request:</p>
    <code><pre class="code">var playValues=[];</pre></code>
    <p> 2- Inside the static function <strong>preloadImages</strong> we will now fill the playValues list
     with the values from the request. The function now need to be async since we need to "await"
     for the request. See the full changed function (the parts that changed are marked):</p>
     <code><pre class="code">
        <span class="marked">static</span> async preloadImages() {
            let cardImgs = {}
            <span class="marked">let cards = await getCards();
            for (let card of cards) {
                let playValue = card.crd_name;
                playValues.push(playValue);</span>
                cardImgs[playValue] = loadImage('./assets/'+playValue+'.png');
            }
            Card.initImgs(cardImgs);
        }    
     </pre></code>
     <p> You will also need to change the names of the images to match the names of the card values.
         In windows it will probably work with the lower case names, but for Mac and Linux file names
         are case sensitive (<strong>and Heroku is Linux</strong>). 
     </p>
     <p> <strong>WARNING:</strong> If you change only the case of a filename Git will consider that the 
        file is the same and will not rename the file, meaning that on GitHub the file would continue to be lower cased.
    You can use the "mv" command of git to rename the files. In the terminal use the following commands to rename:</p>
    <strong><code><pre>
        git mv public/assets/paper.png public/assets/Paper.png
        git mv public/assets/rock.png public/assets/Rock.png
        git mv public/assets/scissors.png public/assets/Scissors.png</pre></code></strong>
    <p> Finally, we need to change our post model function <strong>play</strong>. 
        First, delete the <strong>"var beats=..." </strong>
        line, we will not need it anymore now that we have the card table.
         Then change the code to the code bellow (the parts that changes are marked):</p>
    <code><pre class="code">
        module.exports.play = async function (id, value) {
            try {
             <span class="marked"> if (!parseInt(id)) {
                return { status: 400, result: { msg: "Room id must be a number" } };      
              }
              let sql = `select * from room, card
                where room.roo_id = $1 and
                room.roo_topcard_id = card.crd_winsover_id 
                and card.crd_name ILIKE $2;`
              let result = await pool.query(sql, [id,value]);
              if (result.rows.length == 0) {
                let sqlr = `select * from room, card where room.roo_id = $1 
                            and room.roo_topcard_id = card.crd_id`;
                let resultr = await pool.query(sqlr, [id]);
                let room = resultr.rows[0];
                if (!room) {</span>
                  return { status: 404, result: { msg: "No room with that id" } };
                } else {
                  return {
                    status: 200,
                    result: {
                      victory: false,
                      msg: "You Lost! That card does not beat the top card.",
                      current_topcard: <span class="marked">room.crd_name</span>         
                    }
                  };
                }
              }
              <span class="marked">let card_id =  result.rows[0].crd_id;
              let card_name = result.rows[0].crd_name;</span>
              let sql2 = "UPDATE room SET roo_topcard_id = $1 WHERE roo_id = $2";
              let result2 = await pool.query(sql2, [ <span class="marked"> card_id, id </span> ]);
              if (result2.rowCount == 0) {
                return { status: 500, 
                         result: { msg: "Not able to update. Many possible reasons (ex: room was deleted during play)" } };
              }
              return {
                status: 200,
                result: {
                  victory: true,
                  msg: "You Won!",
                  current_topcard: <span class="marked">card_name</span>
                }
              };
            } catch (err) {
              console.log(err);
              return { status: 500, result: err };
            }
          }    </pre></code>
        <p> The first part is completly different since we replaced the "beats" data structure with the "card table".
            The first if is actually a new error check, making sure the room id we send is an integer:
        </p>
        <p> Next we have our main verification query. This query will return zero lines or one, being one if
            we can find a room with the id we are looking and where the 
            topcard looses against the card the player played. 
        </p>
        <p> If no line is returned either we choose an invalid room (return 404) or our 
            card does not beat the topcard of that room (return 200 saying we lost).
            To see if the room exists we made the query on the variable "sqlr".
        </p>
        <p> All the other modifications were done to make sure the correct names and ids are now used, since now
            we don't have a value in the room topcard but an id.  </p>
        <p><strong>Read the code and try to understand the details. If you have any questions ask the teacher in 
            class since this is a function with many details.</strong></p>

            <h2>2- Change the game to a more complex one (database and server change) </h2>
            <p> We will now change our game to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. This game was
                introduced in the Big Bang Therory series and not only has five values but each
                value also can beat two other values. You can see a description of the game and context
                <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors,_Lizard,_Spock"> here</a>
                (includes a video of that part of the episode).
            </p>
            <p> Since each card can not beat two other a new table was need called cwc (card wins card).
                This means we will need to change our models again, but this time we will not need to make any modifications to the client, 
                except for the fact that we now need 2 more images with the name equal to the 2 new values (the images are actually on the server).
                You can download the two images here (do not forget to include the references):
