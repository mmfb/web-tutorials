      <h2>1- Create your group project</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <p> One of the members of the group creates the initial code using express-generator: </p>
            <strong><code><pre> express --git --no-view &lt;project-name&gt;</pre></code></strong>
            <p> Like we did in the instalation tutorial (<a href="./instalation.html#generator">here</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li> <p>That same member creates the repository by going to the Source Control tab on the left panel and 
            doing the 3 git commands:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Stage all files to be commited using the + sign that appears when you mouseover Changes.</li>
                <li> Commit by written a message in the message entry and then pressing the V button above.</li>
                <li> When all is commited a button should show for you to create a repository on GitHub. When pressed it will:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Create a new GitHub repository (private or public, depending on what you choose) with the name you choose 
                            (by default is the name you gave to your project folder)</li>
                        <li> Set the git remote of your project to that that newly created repository </li>
                        <li> Push all the files to that GitHub repository</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p> We did this in the instalation tutorial (<a href="./instalation.html#github">here</a>)</p>
        </li>
        <li> <p> Now that same member goes to GitHub and invites the other members: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Go to your news GitHub repository and then to the Settings menu (the last one, in the right)</li>
            <li> On the menu on the left hoose Collaborators (you will need to write your password)</li>
            <li> Press the Add People button for each collaborator and write the username.</li>
            <li> Each collaborator will need to go to the email they set for GitHub and accept the invite. 
                The repository will now show on their GitHub account
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These steps were described also in the instalation tutorial (<a href="./instalation.html#collabs">here</a>)</p> 
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Each collaborator can now not only clone the repository but also sync any changes he does</p>
            <p> Open a new VSCode window and you will have a "Clone GitHub Repository" button on the Get Stared tab.
                You also have a button Clone Repository in the Source Control menu.
            </p>
            <p> Press the button click on the option "clone from GitHub" and choose the repository</p>
            <p> It will ask you to choose a folder and it will create a subfolder with all the project code, a local git repository with
                all the versions, and set up the remote to the GitHub repository from where you cloned</p>
            <p> Each time you Sync your code modifications your colleagues will be able to see the changes by using Sync or Pull</p>
            <p> We talked about to clone and sync your changes in the instalation tutorial
                (<a href="./instalation.html#clone">here</a>  and <a href="./instalation.html#sourcecontrol">here</a> respectively).
            </p> 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p> And that is it, you can also set Heroku to this repository and create your project database</p>
    </section>
    <section>
 s       <h2>2- Define your project and REST Api</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> First define what will be your project (if you have not already) in general terms</li>
            <li> Now see what functionalities you would like to have</li>
            <li> Identify what entities you will need. From those and their relations you will start creating the database.
                From those, the database and the functionalities you will determine the rest resources you need            </li>
            <li> Start defining endpoints you will need for the functionalities you defined and define to what resource they correspond</li>
            <li> Divide the work between all collaborators and start creating the documentantion as we talked about in the <a href="./restinterface.html">rest interface tutorial</a> </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>3- Create your code</h2>
        <p> Since you are learning, this step and step 2 will iterate together until you 
            reach the goal.  
            You will create some rules and try to implement, 
            and then go back to change something because you found out there is a better
             way, you need to add something more or the project idea changed.</p>
        <p> Divide the tasks by all collaborators. Does not mean you cannot help each other or work together, but
            you each have your own tasks that you are responsible for, and can work by yourself also. 
            Some tasks may be done has a group.
        </p>
        <p> Do not forget to test:
            <ul>
                <li> Test the database queries on the database client first (pgadmin)</li>
                <li> Test the server endpoints individually using the browser (get) or postman</li>
                <li> The client side (when you start that part) is the last thing to test, since it depends on all others</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> Also be carefull with:
            <ul>
                <li> The paths of the endpoints and methods used. Follow what was teached in class to define a
                    REST interface that follows a clear template
                </li>
                <li> Names. Always use the same naming convention for Routes and Models files, for variables, 
                    for function names</li>
                <li> Always set the try/catch and always place some console.log on the catch to print the error</li>
                <li> Always write something on the beggining of the route code to see that you got to that endpoint and what was sent</li>
                <li> If you are having a hard time debugging start placing some console.log in the code to see what is happening 
                    (don't forget to delete them after if they are too many)</li> 
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> The basics of creating a rest api were described in the <a href="./restinterface.html"> rest interface tutorial</a>
            but you will learn more techniques on the course,  make your own research and combine all those to create specific solutions. 
            You will also learn how to create the client-side code during the course (first try <a href="./firstgui.html">here</a>). </p>
