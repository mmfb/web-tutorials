      <h1> What is REST? </h1>
      <p> REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
        It was the result of a <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">
          dissertation by Roy Fielding in 2000</a>.</p>
       <p> REST defines some guiding principles and constraints:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Uniform Interface</h3>
          <p> Interfaces should be recognizable by their users by using common designs and rules. 
            We call this the <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/~gshute/softeng/principles.html"> Principle of Generality </a></p>
          <p> Constrains for an uniform interface :</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Clearly indentify resources.</strong> A resource corresponds to an entity managed by the application. 
              Can correspond to a database table but you do not need a resource for each table (for example, you can have an address table
               but you can access user addresses from the users resource)   
              Examples:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>/api/users</strong> Resource that contains user information. /api/users/2/addresses can obtain
               the addresses of user with id 2.</li>
               <li><strong>/api/levels</strong> Obtains general information of all levels. 
                Specific information of level 2 can be obtained like /api/levels/2, or specifically the characters of that level as /api/levels/2/characters</li>
              <li><strong>/api/characters</strong> Obtains general information of all characters in the game. This is different from the previous one that obtains 
                the characters for a specific level, meaning you can access the same information from different directions, using the relationship between entities</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Manipulation of resources through representations.</strong> Clients should be able
              to receive a resource and do adictional requests for more information about that resource or
              to modify its state. That means we need to have a uniform way to refer to that resource (one way
              to do it is to use the primary key of the database to identify each entity, but there are other ways).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Self-descriptive messages.</strong> Clients should know how to process the message, so it is important
            to the data type (Internet Media Type or MIME type). This is actually automatically done by express and in our case it will be JSON. </li>
              <li> HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). This means the client should be able
                to obtain all available operations from the initial url. Meaning /api/ would have informathion of all resources, 
                /api/users everything that can be done with users, and so on. There are ways to do this, but must APIs do not do this (we will also not do it). </li>
              </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Client-Server</h3>
          <p> There should be a clear separation between server and client. So the server should be created
            to "server" any request that make senses for the problem at end and not only for a specific client.
          </p>
          <p> This allows for the server api to be used, as is, by any client, increasing scalability. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Stateless</h3>
          <p> State should be saved on client side or database. The server should not save information of previous interactions with the user.</p>
          <p> In each request the client should send all the information necessary to process that request.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Cacheable</h3>
          <p> Responses should send information if it is cacheable or not. Cacheable responses can be reused
            by the client for some periods, while non-cacheable need to be asked to the server each time.
          </p>
          <p> We will not worry about this and let Express used the default settings for this.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Layered system</h3>
          <p> Our architecture should be layered. Each component should only worry about the layer his working in.</p>
          <p> Our application will probably not be complex enough for this, though by dividing our server by resources and subresources we should achieve some layering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Code on demand (optional)</h3>
          <p> This means some requests may send code that would be run on server side. This would be an advanced feature 
            that we will also not worry about. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A server that follows this guiding principles and constraints is called a RESTful server.
        Many servers decide to not follow some of the principles (like HATEOAS or stateless) and are still 
        called RESTful by most.
      </p> 
    </section>
    <section id="endpoints">
      <h1> Rest endpoints and documenting a REST interface </h1>
      <p> A rest endpoint is composed by the url and the method.</p>
      <p> The url is a path or hyperlink for 
        a specific resource or group of resources. Resources and subresources in the path are represented
        by plural names. Specific resources are indicated by identifiers. Other parameters and names can also be used to filter resources. 
      </p>
      <p> The method identifies the action we want to do to the resource. If resources are all about names, the method is the verb: 
        GET (obtain), POST (add), PUT (edit full resource), PATCH (edit part of the resource), DELETE (delete). 
      </p>
      <p>Lets consider a "small" game:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li> You have levels in the game that will have characters, each with its caracteristics.</li>
        <li> You have users, that are players. Each user has information, that includes the maximum level he was able to run.</li>
        <li> The users also have characters, that may change after a level is completed.</li> 
        <li> The users also have a log with information of the battles he has done.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> First we need to decide which resources will we need to manage. We can consider only two for now, users and levels.</p>
      <p> Next we need to define our endpoints. Some examples with a description: </p>
      <p><strong>The users resource</strong></p>
      <!--
        <table border="1">
        <tr><td colspan="2"> </td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Parameters:</strong></td><td></td></tr>
      </table>
    -->
    <table border="1">
      <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong> Get user by id</strong><br>
        Obtains the profile information of the user.</td></tr>
      <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td><strong>/api/users/:id (get)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>  :id is the id of the user</td></tr>
    </table> <br>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong>Get user characters</strong><br>
        Obtains the characters used by the user.</td></tr>
      <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td> <strong>/api/users/:id/characters (get)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the user</td></tr>
  </table>
      <p><strong>The levels resource</strong></p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong> Get level information </strong><br>
          Obtains the information of a specific level, including the list of characters of that level.</td></tr>
          <tr> <td> Url (method)</td> <td> <strong>/api/levels/:id (get)</strong></td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the level</td></tr>
      </table>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <p> Noticed we did not need to define /api/levels/:id/characters because we considered that it would make sense to 
        send this information when we sent the general level inforamation. But we could decide to have the two separated endpoins.
      </p>
      <p> These endpoints will allow us to get information about the player or levels, but it does not let us play the game.</p>
      <p> We need to need to have "battles". Each battle will use some of the player characters and 
        the level characters and have a result that could than be shown to the user.</p> 
      <p> The player characters may change after the battle and the level will increase if he wins a battle in the maximum current level.
        This would require some effort coding but fortunatly we are only thinking about defining our REST API, and this corresponds to only one endpoint, creating the battle </p>
      <p> We could create a new resource for battles, it is valid, but the endpoints will probably be much clearer if we
        create them as <strong>subresources of the users resource</strong>. The main rule we need is to create the battle, but we can also have the log of battles.
      </p>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong> Create a battle </strong><br>
          Create a battle of a user in one level. </td></tr>
          <tr> <td> Url (method)</td> <td> <strong>/api/users/:id/battles (post)</strong></td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the user</td></tr>
        <tr><td> Data:</td><td>
          level - the level the user is playing <br>
          characters - the user characters the user is using to play <br>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Response:</td><td>
          win or loose<br>
          characters after battle <br>
          if level changed <br>
          information to make the animation
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Error:</td><td>
          <strong>Code: 422 Unprocessable  Entry</strong><br> 
          Possible messages: Invalid level, Invalid character list 
        </td></tr>
      </table><br>
      <table border="1">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong>Get user battles</strong><br>
        Obtains the battles made by the user. Each battle says the date, the level the player was, 
        the level the player played, if it was a loss or victory, 
        the characters the player used, the changes the characters had</td></tr>
      <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td> <strong>/api/users/:id/battles (get)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the user</td></tr>
  </table>
<p> Notice that for the creation of the battle we needed much more information. Some of the information
   cannot be send on the parameters, it is sended as data. Parameters are sent in the URL, the data is sent on 
   the body of the request.
</p>
<p> We also declared information about the results. Both normal result and error.</p>
<p> All endpoints will send responses, we only described it at this point because it is not implicit on the description.
  When we create our documentation we will need to give examples of the results for each endpoint.
</p>
<p> Error responses are also important. Getting the user profile could give us an error that the id did not exist, 
  but the battle creation has that type of error, and all the errors that correspond to erroneous information sent by the user.</p>
<p> <strong>Remember that we should have client-server separation.</strong> That means we cannot consider that every possible client will
send correct information. An example would be a player trying to create a request to play in a level he was not yet able to play (trying to exploit the game).</p>

<p> These tables already provide you with a simple example on how to document your REST interface. 
  You can see more information you can add to each endpoint here: 
  <a href="https://bocoup.com/blog/documenting-your-api">REST API Documentation Best Practices</a>
</p>
<p> You do not need to use all the elements for each endpoint, only the ones that make sense.
  Title, URL, Method and result are necessary for all. 
  Parameters, Data and Errors are only needed for those that have them.  </p>
<p> You can see another example of REST documentation 
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gViN7kRhEMq9jiIjk5eDA5ctw39OcliWW7jO5f4-4ho">
    here</a>  (in Portughese). The example is for an application that would manage information 
    about music albuns. It is based on the  
    <a href="https://github.com/cwoodruff/ChinookDatabase"> Chinook opensource database</a>.

      <h3>Creating REST endpoints in Node.js/Express.js</h3>
      <p> The previous example is still too big for a starting tutorial so we will use a simpler game. 
        Actually this will be the application we already started on the previous tutorial (if you used the database described in class). </p>
      <p> We will consider the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. We will consider that at any given time the 
        database has one of those 3 values and a play will be sending one of those 3 given values. 
        The player wins if the value he sent beats the value in the database. At that time the value changes to the one the player played.
      </p>
      <p> With only one player this game is predictable, but if many players are playing the player will need to play fast or be lucky to win, 
        since the values will be always changing.</p>
      <p> On our previous tutorial we already created one resource for rooms (with model and route) and an endpoint to obtain all the rooms:</p>
      <table border="1" id="allrooms">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong>Get all rooms information</strong><br>
        Obtains list of rooms, each with the name and current top card</td></tr>
      <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td> <strong>/api/rooms (get)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Result:</td><td>[{"roo_id":1,"roo_name":"Room 1","roo_topcard":"Rock"}] </td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>Notice that it is easy to fill in the result information in the documentation when we already have the implementation, just place one example.
        Of course if we had many rooms we will not place all the information, something like this would be enough for the documentation:<br>
        [{"roo_id":1,"roo_name":"Room 1","roo_topcard":"Rock"} ...]
      </p>
      <p> We ignored the 500 error. This error will exist for every endpoint but only occurs if something is wrong on the server, for instance if the database is down.
        It would be correct to include this error for all endpoints, but it is not as important as other errors, and would overcomplicate the documentation.
      </p>
      <p> Now to play we need two new rules: one to get the information of a specific room (including the topcard) and another to play a new card to a room. </p>
      <p> Lets start with the first one. This one is very similar to the previous one but now we receive a parameter to choose which room. 
        The id of the table is the parameter that is easier to use since each rooms has an unique id (we will see other ways to filter information). </p>
      <p> So our endpoint will be like this: </p>
      <table border="1" id="oneroom">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong>Get a room by id</strong><br>
        Obtains the information of the room that corresponds to the id received</td></tr>
      <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td> <strong>/api/rooms/:id (get)</strong></td></tr>
      <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the room</td></tr>
      <tr><td>Result:</td><td>{"roo_id":1,"roo_name":"Room 1","roo_topcard":"Rock"} </td></tr>
      <tr><td> Error:</td><td>
        <strong>Code: 404 Not found</strong> When no room exists with that id <br> 
        {"msg":"No room with that id"}
      </td></tr>
      </table>
      <p> Notice that in this case the result is not a list, since the id is unique only one room or none will be retrieved. 
        If no room exists with that id a 404 error will be shown.
      </p>
      <p> Code to add on the <strong>roomsRoutes.js</strong> file (before the final "module.exports" line):</p>
      <section class="columns">
        <strong>
          <pre class="code">
router.get('/:id', async function(req, res, next) {
  let id = req.params.id;
  console.log("Get room with id "+id)
  let result = await rModel.getRoomById(id);
  res.status(result.status).send(result.result);
});</pre>
        </strong>
  </section>
  <p> Notice that now we have something different in the path: <strong>:id</strong>. 
    This corresponds to a parameter that will be sent by the user, the value that the user sends in the place where the 
    :id is will be saved as a parameter in the request. This is done by one of the parsing middlewares that was included in our application. 
    </p>
    <p> Inside the function we have <strong>req.params.id</strong> that is where we retrive the parameter value from the request, and then use it to call
    the model function <strong>rModel.getRoomById(id)</strong></p>
    <p> This function must be added, with this name and one parameter, to the <strong>roomsModel.js</strong> file:</p>
    <section class="columns">
      <strong>
        <pre class="code">
          module.exports.getRoomById = async function (id) {
            try {
              let sql = "Select * from room where roo_id = $1";
              let result = await pool.query(sql, [id]);
              if (result.rows.length > 0) {
                let room = result.rows[0];
                return { status: 200, result: room };
              } else {
                return { status: 404, result: { msg: "No room with that id" } };
              }
            } catch (err) {
              console.log(err);
              return { status: 500, result: err };
            }
          }</pre>
      </strong>
</section>
<p> We used the same name for the function and the function receives one parameter ( "function (id)" ).</p>
<p> Or sql string now has a where clause to filter by roo_id, but the value is $1. 
  All values of this type will be replaced later with values sent by the user, in this case by the id sent.</p>
  <p> The reason we do not add the value manualy to the string is that the value needs to be escaped to make sure it is not 
    considered a SQL command. This escaping can be done by the library we are using. Failing to do this escaping will
    create a known security mistake that can be used by hackers. This kind of attacks is called "SQL Injection" and consists
    in the user sending SQL commands instead of simple values and without this escaping the command will be run at our database.
    The command can be something to get private information or to delete information and can have a huge impact in the application 
    ( <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_injection.asp"> see more about SQL Injection</a>)
    </p>
    <p> In the next line we see that the query is called with the sql string and an array with one parameter.
       This parameter will be escaped by the library and inserted where the $1 is. We need to have one value in the array
       for each $ we have in our sql string.
    </p>
    <p>Another thing that is different in this function is that the result will always be one or zero rows, since there is only
      one room or none with that id. The query will always return an array so we return an error 404 if the array is empty or
      the first element if one is returned.
    </p> 
    <p> <strong>NOTE:</strong> This tutorial considers that the students already know the basics of programming. 
    Some concepts will be explained in class but for basic syntaxe you can check the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp"> Javascript W3schools tutorial</a>. </p>
    <p> And that is it, we do not need to change the <strong>app.js</strong> file since the route file was already connected to the app.
     Each REST resource will correspond to a new routes file with several endpoints, but you will only connect the route file to the app once.</p> 
    <p> You can test this endpoint on your browser by writting <strong>localhost:3000/api/rooms/1</strong></p>
     <p> Our next task is to create the endpoint to make plays. We could create this inside a resource for plays, but a play is made by an user in a room, 
      we do not have users yet, but we do have rooms, and it makes sense for the play endpoint to be associated to the room. So our endpoint will be like this:</p>
      <table border="1" id="play">
        <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong> Play a card in a room </strong><br>
          Plays a card in a room. If the card beats the room top card the top card of the rooms changes to the new card.
        It will return to the user if he won or not and what was the top card. </td></tr>
          <tr> <td> Url (method)</td> <td> <strong>/api/rooms/:id/play (post)</strong></td></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:id is the id of the room</td></tr>
        <tr><td> Data:</td><td>
        <code><pre>
        {
          "cardPlayed": "paper"
        } </pre></code>        
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Response:</td><td>
          If the player wins: <br>
          <code><pre>
{
  "victory": true,
  "msg": "You Won!",
  "current_topcard": "paper"
}</pre></code>              
          If the player looses <br>
          <code><pre>
{
  victory: false,
  msg: "You Lost! That card does not beat the top card.",
  "current_topcard": "rock"
}</pre></code>
        </td></tr>
        <tr><td> Errors:</td><td>
          <strong>Code: 404 Not found</strong> When no room exists with that id <br>

<p> We have considered this endpoint a POST since we considered that we are adding a play to the room.
  We could also consider it a PUT or PATCH if we consider we are trying to change the topcard with our play.
  However, it would never be a GET endpoint like the previous ones.</p>
<p> This POST endpoint has both parameters and data. Parameters will go on the URL and data in the body of the message, 
  and will have different ways to be processed in our code. </p>
<p> Add the endpoint to the route file:</p>  
<section class="columns">
  <strong>
    <pre class="code">
router.post('/:id/plays', async function(req, res, next) {
  let id = req.params.id;
  let cardPlayed = req.body.cardPlayed.toLowerCase();
  console.log(`Played card ${cardPlayed} on room with id ${id}`);
  let result = await rModel.play(id,cardPlayed);
  res.status(result.status).send(result.result);
});
      </pre>
  </strong>
</section>
<p> First notice that we defined a post rule so we needed to use the "router.post" instead of "router.get". </p>
<p> We have the id parameter again, retrieved with <strong>req.params.id</strong> but now we also
have information in the body of the message that is retrievd using <strong>req.body</strong>.
To avoid problems with caps we passed the received value to lower letter using the toLowerCase method of the String data.</p>
<p> Both the id and the played card are passed to the model method. We need to create a model method called "play" that receives those two values.</p> 
<p> First we will create a auxiliary data structure that will help us determine which card beats other card.
  We will use a javascript object since it can be used like an hashmap, key/value data structure where the 
  key will be one card and the value the card that looses with the key:
</p>
<strong><code><pre>var beats = { rock: 'scissors', scissors: 'paper', paper: 'rock' };</pre></code></strong>
<p> We can check what card can be beaten by paper by doing <strong> beats['paper']</strong></p>
<p> We can now add the model function:</p>  
<section class="columns">
  <strong>
    <pre class="code">
module.exports.play = async function (id, value) {
  try {
    if (!beats[value]) {
      return { status: 400, result: { msg: "Card value is not valid (rock,paper,scissors)" } };
    }
    let sql = "Select * from room where roo_id = $1";
    let result = await pool.query(sql, [id]);
    if (result.rows.length == 0) {
      return { status: 404, result: { msg: "No room with that id" } };
    }
    let room = result.rows[0];
    if (beats[value] != room.roo_topcard.toLowerCase()) {
      return {
        status: 200,
        result: {
          victory: false,
          msg: "You Lost! That card does not beat the top card.",
          current_topcard: room.roo_topcard
        }
      };
    }
    let sql2 = "UPDATE room SET roo_topcard = $1 WHERE roo_id = $2";
    let result2 = await pool.query(sql2, [value, id]);
    if (result2.rowCount == 0) {
      return { status: 500, 
                result: { msg: "Not able to update. Many possible reasons (ex: room was deleted during play)" } };
    }
    return {
      status: 200,
      result: {
        victory: true,
        msg: "You Won!",
        current_topcard: value
      }
    };

  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
    return { status: 500, result: err };
  }
}</pre>
  </strong> </section>
<p> This code has several parts. First we receive the id and value as parameters </p>
<p> Next we check if the card value is valid. If we try to use our "hashmap" and the card 
  value is not one of the keys the "beats[value]" will have <strong>undefined</strong> that will be
evaluated as false by the if condition and enter the if returning the error: </p>
<code><pre>
  if (!beats[value]) {
    return { status: 400, result: { msg: "Card value is not valid (rock,paper,scissors)" } };
  }  </pre></code>
</section>
<p> After that we do our first query to retrieve the topcard of the room sending an error if the room does not exist: </p>
<code><pre>
  let sql = "Select * from room where roo_id = $1";
  let result = await pool.query(sql, [id]);
  if (result.rows.length == 0) {
    return { status: 404, result: { msg: "No room with that id" } };
  }</pre></code>
<p> If the room exists we will check if the value of the room top card looses to the played card. 
  If not we send the information that the user lost:</p>
  <code><pre>
  let room = result.rows[0];
  if (beats[value] != room.roo_topcard.toLowerCase()) {
    return {
        ...
          victory: false,
        ...
        }
    };
  }</pre></code>
  <p>If the card sent wons we update the room top card and send the information that the user won:</p>
  <p><strong>WARNING: </strong> We are making two separeted queries to the database but these queries depend on each other.
  This should be done using a <strong>transaction</strong>. Without a transaction the top card of the room may change between the moment
we check the value of the room and the moment we change the value, and thus the results may not be correct. With a transaction
the database makes sure the value of the table is not changed until the transaction finishes, and any request to that value will 
have to wait until the transaction finishes. You may learn more about transactions later, for now we will not worry about this possibility. </p>
 <code><pre>
  let sql2 = "UPDATE room SET roo_topcard = $1 WHERE roo_id = $2";
  let result2 = await pool.query(sql2, [value, id]);
  ...
  return {
    ...
      victory: true,
     ...
    }
  };</pre></code>
  <p> Notice that this query needs to receive two parameters so we have $1 and $2 and an array with two values</p>
  <p> We also have an error check in the middle (first ...). This error will occour if the update is not done.
    Since we made all verifications to the values sent by the client, this can only occour on a server of database error 
    and is again a 500 error (server error) that was ommited from the documentation but that is important to check on code, 
    so we do not send the victory message if no changes were made. 
</main>
<code><pre>
  if (result2.rowCount == 0) {
    return { status: 500, 
              result: { msg: "Not able to update. Many possible reasons (ex: room was deleted during play)" } };
  }</pre></code>
  <p> Since this endpoint is not a GET you cannot test it directly in the browser. When writing an URL in the browser
    you are always making GET requests. To test this endpoint you will need a program like 
    <a href="https://www.postman.com/"> Postman</a>. You can download the App or run it from the browser 
    (the App will be the one demonstrated in classes).
  </p>
  <p> To test write <strong>localhost:3000/api/rooms/1/plays</strong> in the url and in the body tab
  write <strong>{ "cardPlayed":"paper" }</strong> (or another card value). Do not forget to set the
  datatype of the body to "raw" and then on the right to "JSON" instead of "Text" (you have a class short tutorial with more details 
  and printscreens)
  </p>
  <p> Now you can play your game. Ask some colleagues to play with you. If you have your online server it will be easy. 
    If you are only running locally your colleagues will need to replace the localhost by your IP and they need to be on the 
  same network (ask the professor for help if you are not able to try this).</p> 
  <p>We can add more endpoints now. For instance, if we have many rooms we may want to have an endpoint to filter the rooms by name or by topcard.</p>
  <p>Filters can be done using query parameters on the url, for instance: <strong>/api/rooms/filter?name=Room 1&topcard=rock</strong>. You can see the documentation bellow:</p>
  <table border="1" id="filter">
    <tr><td> Title</td><td><strong>Get the rooms by name and/or top card</strong><br>
    Obtains the information of the rooms that correspond to the name and/or the top card given. 
  Both values can be send or only one of them. Name will do partial match while top card will allow only full match.</td></tr>
  <tr><td> Url (method) </td><td> <strong>/api/rooms/filter?name=:name&topcard=:topcard (get)</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>:name Show only rooms that have that the name includes the text on this parameter<br>
  :topcard Show only rooms that have this value has topcard</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Result:</td><td>[{"roo_id":1,"roo_name":"Room 1","roo_topcard":"Rock"}] </td></tr>
  <tr><td> Error:</td><td>
    <strong>Code: 400 Bad Request</strong> When no parameters to filter are sent<br> 
    {"msg":"No filters defined (name or topcard)"}
  </td></tr>

  </table>
  <p>In this case we only send an error if no filter parameter is sent, an invalid parameter will result on an empty result list. 
    If the parameters match any rooms a list with those rooms is sent. If no room exist an empty list will be sent. </p> 
    <p> Add the endpoint to the route file:</p>
    <p> <strong>WARNING:</strong> You need to add this endpoint before the /api/rooms/:id endpoint.
    If not calling /api/rooms/filter?... will result in calling /api/rooms/:id with id equal to "filter".
  By placing this endpoint first, the requests with filter will match this endpoint and any other value will call the 
  /api/rooms/:id endpoint. It is also possible to say that the :id parameter is only valid for numbers 
  (<a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html"> you can user regular expressions in the route paths</a>).</p>  
    <section class="columns">

    </section>
   <p> The only thing new is the <strong>req.query</strong> data. This will correspond to an object with one
  attribute for each parameter that was on the query string (after the ? in the URL). Example: 
  <strong>/api/rooms/filter?name=Room 1&topcard=rock</strong> will correspond to the object
  <strong>{ name: 'Room', topcard: 'rock' }</strong></p>
  <p> On the model file you will need to create the method that receives the query object:</p>

        module.exports.getRoomByNameOrTopCard = async function (parameters) {
          try {
            if (!parameters.name && !parameters.topcard) {
              return { status: 400, result: { msg: "No filters defined (name or topcard)" } };
            }
            let nparam = 1;

              values.push("%"+parameters.name+"%");
              nparam++;
            }
            if (parameters.topcard) {
              if (parameters.name) sql+=" AND"
              sql += ` roo_topcard LIKE $${nparam}`;
              values.push(parameters.topcard);

            let rooms = result.rows;
            return { status: 200, result: rooms };
          } catch (err) {
            console.log(err);
            return { status: 500, result: err };
          }
        }  
        </pre>
    </strong>
  </section>
<p> The first thing we check is if we receive at least one parameter, if not we send an error.
  Javascript will not give an error if we try to access an object attribute that does not exist, it will
  just return undefined for that, and undefined is considered to be false in a boolean expression.
</p>
<code><pre>
if (!parameters.name && !parameters.topcard) {
  return { status: 400, result: { msg: "No filters defined (name or topcard)" } };
}</pre></code>
<p>The next line define variables we will need. The "nparams" will allow us to know at what count
  of parameters we are, so we can generate the $1, $2, etc for our SQL string. The values will start with
  and empty list where we will add each value that will correspond to the $1, $2 etc in the sql query.
  And finally the initial query string where we will also add more text corresponding to each filtered parameter. 
</p>
<code><pre>           
  let nparam = 1;
  let values = [];
  let sql = "Select * from room where";</pre></code>
  <p> We then check for each filtered parameter that has a defined value and create 
    the string to add to the query string and the value to add to the list.</p>
  <p> For the name parameter we push the value with "%" on both sides, so that SQL will allow
     for a partial match anywhere in the middle of the text.</p>
   <code><pre>
  if (parameters.name) {
    sql += ` roo_name LIKE $${nparam}`;
    values.push("%"+parameters.name+"%");
    nparam++;
  }</pre></code> 
  <p> Using ` ` instead of " " allows us to insert values inline in the string. Each time we write
    ${} in the string the expression inside the {} will be evaluated and add to the string in that place. In this case
    the value inserted will be the current nparam value, and it will preceded by $ to make the $1, $2 etc. 
  The "push" array method will add the received value to the end of the array. 
  "++" operator increments the value of the variable by one.</p>
  <p> <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Notice that we have a space before the roo_name. Do not forget spaces when concatenating query strings.
  Without it we will end up with "... whereroo_name ..." and the database would give us an error for our query.</p>
<p>For the topcard parameter we need first to check if we already place the name filter on the query string. If so we need
  to add the AND keyword to make a valid SQL query. In this case we did not add the "%" to our value since we want an exact match.
</p> 
<code><pre>
  if (parameters.topcard) {
    if (parameters.name) sql+=" AND"
    sql += ` roo_topcard LIKE $${nparam}`;
    values.push(parameters.topcard);
    nparam++;
  }</pre></code> 
<p> The last lines are already know to us, make the query and send the results. Since it is a list 
  (even if the filter gives us one o zero rooms) we do not need to make aditional checks, similar to our first endpoint. </p>
<p> You can test this endpoint in your browser like this <strong>localhost:3000/api/rooms/filter?name=1&topcard=paper</strong></p>
<h4>To do:</h4>
<p> You can now add more endpoints or even new resources. You may want to create new tables on your database also. Group up with some 
  of your colleagues and think how to add new functionalities or to make this game more complex. Think which endpoints you would need, 
  make the documentation, and try to implement your idea. </p>
  <p> You can also do the same for a completly new idea, for instance for your own group project.</p>
