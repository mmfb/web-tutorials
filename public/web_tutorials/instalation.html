        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>At the top right you see two IDE (Integrated Development Environment) used to create code and manage
              databases:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong><a href=" o https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a></strong>
                  Editor for code, including all things web (
                  <a href="#html">HTML</a>, <a href="#css">CSS</a>,
                  <a href="#javascript">Javascript</a>, etc)
                </p>
                <p>You can also get Notepad++:
                <ul>
                  <li> It is also an editor for any type of text file </li>
                  <li> It is lighter and good for quick modifications</li>
                </ul>
                <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/</a>

              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Database Client Application</strong>

                  Applications to manage and develop databases, they will depend on the database used. Examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/">Workbench</a></strong>
                      Allows the design and management of MySql databases and similar </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong><a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/">pgAdmin</a></strong>
                      Open Source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL </p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Bellow the IDEs, connected to the DB Client you see the databases.
              This constitutes the base of the three tiers that usually constitute a web application:
              <strong>Database | Server | Client </strong>.
            </p>
            <p> For local server you can use a local or a remote database,
              but for an online server you will need a remote database,
              because it would be really hard to connect to the local server.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> In the top middle you see a depiction of the <a href="#node_express">Node.js/Express.js</a> server. The
              server is divided in two parts:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Web Pages Server</strong>
                Will serve HTML, CSS, Javascript and other files (ex: images) to the browser clients
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong><a href="#rest">REST</a> API Server</strong>
                  Will serve data requested by web pages on the browser (using <a href="#ajax">AJAX</a>
                  and <a href="#json">JSON</a>) and could also serve data to
                  other applications (using JSON).</p>
                <p>
                  Since the REST API is responsible to manage data, only this part of the server will communicate with
                  the
                  database.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> In the top left side you see the client side:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Browser</strong>
                  Browsers like chrome, safari or edge will need web pages composed by HTML, CSS, images, etc.
                  All these files will be sent by the Web Pages Server.</p>
                <p> Some of these pages will also need data.
                  These pages will have javascripts that will request the data from the REST API Server
                  (the one that can obtain data from the Database) and insert that data on the web pages </p>
                <p>Some pages will also send data to the REST API also using javascript.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Apps</strong>
                  Applications like mobile applications or desktop programs can also comunicate with the server.
                </p>
                <p> Since applications will have their own interface they only need the data so they only connecto to
                  the
                  REST API Server.</p>
              </li>

            </ul>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> In the bottom, inside the cloud, you have a depiction of the online web server.
              It replicates the same elements as the local web server: clients,
              Node.js/Express.js server and database (the online database).
              The Node.js/Express.js server is divided in the same way in Web Page Server and REST API Server.
            </p>
            <p>
              To create an online server you need a provider.
              We give as example the <a href="#heroku">Cyclic</a> platform that suports Node.js servers and where you
              can easilly deploy applications from your public <a href="#github">github</a> repository.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea is simple:
            <ol>
              <li>Create a local <a href="#git">git</a> repository that will allow us to manage versions and connect to
                a
                remote repository.</li>
              <li>Push the latest version to a remote git repository like <a href="github">
                  GitHub</a>.</li>
              <li>Connect your GitHub account with Cyclic and create an App that connects to a repository.
                After configuring this connection Cyclic will automatically deploy the latest version
                of the code each time the GitHub repository is updated.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
              You can see more details on how to deploy a Node Web Application on Cyclic on <a
                href="#deploy_cyclic">another section of this tutorial</a>.

      <h3>What do you need to have</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Install Node.js</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">https://nodejs.org/en/</a></p>
          <p>Choose the LTS version (recommended for most users). Download and install Node.js.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Install Visual Studio Code (Web Editor)</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a></p>
          <p> When installing you have an option that will let you open a
            project folder directly from the explorer using right click (at least on windows).</p>
          <p class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('vscode_install',false,'block')"> Click to see an image of the VSCode
            instalation window</p>
          <p class="centerImg canHide" id="vscode_install""><img src=" images/vscode_install.png"
            alt="Node instalation window"></p>
          <p> When you first open a Node project VSCode will detect that it is a Node project
            and ask if you want to install extensions to help you. You can accept those.
            You can also install other extensions if you find them usefull.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Install git</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a></p>
          <p>The package will install the executables needed to run all git commands. ~
            You can call them using the terminal or install a git client. </p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Install Postman</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">https://www.postman.com/downloads/</a></p>
          <p> Although Postman is not needed to run the server, it is useful for testing.
            You can also use other programs for testing, including some VSCode extensions</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Create a Github account</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://github.com/">https://github.com/</a></p>
          <p> Select "Sign Up" and enter your account information.
            You will need a valid email since when you first login you will receive a code on your email
            that you need to write to enter. </p>
          <p> The first time you enter you will also be asked to create your first repository.
            Make it a public repository and give it a name (if you do not know what to call it, call it "myproject").
            If you already have an account create a new public repository instead.</p>
          <p> Create a README file when you create your repository (if you have not created you will always have
            an option to create it after). For now leave the README me as it is and click commit (you can change it
            later).</p>
        </dd>
        <dt><strong>Create a Cyclic account connected to your Github account</strong></dt>
        <dd>
          <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You should only do this step after you created a basic Node.js/Express.js project.
            <a href="#create_server">See the section about creating a server</a>
          </p>
          <p>Site: <a href="https://cyclic.sh/">https://cyclic.sh/</a></p>
          <p> Choose "Sign Up" and then "Continue with Github". If you are already logged to github you only need
            to authorize the connection, otherwise you will ask you to login to your Github. </p>
          <p>You will then be asked to deploy your first App. We assume you already created your code
            on a github repository so you will need to choose the tab that says "Link Your Own".</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally search for the repository name and click on it. Cyclic will retrieve all the information
            it needs from the Node.js configuration file (package.json).
          </p>

      </dl>
      <dt><strong>Install a database and the database client</strong></dt>
      <dd>
        <p> You will need a database for your server.
          The database will not be a topic of this tutorial, only the connection to the database.</p>
        <p>Use the database that is required for your project. Two examples of commonly used databases:</p>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Warning: </strong>
          On free database hosting there can be downtime of the servers and your databases can be deleted without
          notice,
          specially if not being used for a long time or if they exceed the size limits.
          <strong>Always keep a copy</strong> of your database (scripts to create and populate) and <strong>before any
            presentation
            check</strong> if the database is working.

      <h2>2- Creating a Node.js/Express.js project</h2>
      <p>This section of the tutorial considerers that you already have the following setup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Node.js installed</li>
        <li>Git installed</li>
        <li>Visual Studio Code installed</li>
        <li>Github account created and repository created</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('git_clone',false,'block')">Step 1: Clone your Github repository to your
        working directory (click to toggle text) </h3>
      <section id="git_clone">
        <p> First you need to configure your git username and email. These will be saved in every submission you make.
          Sugestion: Use the same email you used for Github and a name that can be recognized. </p>
        <p> Open a terminal. There is your computer's command line, but you also have the "git bash" (installed with
          git)
          and the "node.js command prompt" (installed with node). If for some reason git or node executables are not
          found they may still be used
          using the command line that comes with their installation. </p>
        <p> In the terminal run the following lines (with the name and email you want to use): </p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
          git config --global user.name "Your Name"
          git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
        </code></pre>
        <p> Now change directory to your working directory so that you can clone your Github repository to the correct
          place.
          Cloning will create a directory with the same name as the repository and with all code inside. </p>
        <p> Run the following code to clone (with your username and your project name):</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
          git clone https://github.com/yourname/myproject
        </code></pre>
        <p> Since it is a public repository git will not ask you for authentication. With a private repository or
          when you try to submit changes to any repository you will need to authenticate with your user.</p>
        <p> Next we will learn the basics of git</p>

      <section id="git_management">
        <h4 class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('git_about',false,'block')">About Git (click to toggle text)</h4>
        <section class="canHide" id="git_about">
          <h4>2.1 What is git?</h4>
          <p> Git is a Version Control System (VCS). That means it saves versions of your project code allowing you to
            jump between different versions if you need to.</p>
          <p> Git was created for big projects with many contributers. It is a distributed system that allows several
            programmers to work on the same project and track each contribution individually.</p>
          <p> There are many approaches to VCS. Git considers its approach as snapshots of code.
            Every time a commit is made git will keep the full file if it is different from the previous version. If the
            file did not change it keeps a reference to that file.</p>
          <p> Other systems only keep a registry of changes (called a delta) of files that changed, which uses less
            space but spends
            more time when you want to retrive the file (since it needs to create the file from the deltas).</p>
          <h4>2.2 Local and remote repositores</h4>
          <p> Git is a distributed VCS. That means that each developer has his/her own version of
            the code in a local repository.</p>
          <p> Each developer will work on changes on the local repository and than push those changes to the remote
            repository available to all
            developers.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>When we make changes to the local repository we say that we <strong>commit</strong> the files.</li>
            <li>When we make changes to the remote repository we say that we <strong>push</strong> the files to the
              remote repository.
              Pushing will only work for commited files (see about git file stages in next topic)</li>
          </ul>
          <p> Developers can also pull the changes made by others to keep their local repository updated.
            In fact, <strong>you can only push the changes you made to the remote repository if you have the latest
              version of the remote
              repository</strong> i.e. you will need to pull changes made by other before pushing yours.</p>
          <h4>2.3 File stages in git</h4>
          <p> The git commands you can do depend on what stage your files are. Your files can pass by 4 stages:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong>Modified</strong>. The file was edited but will not be commited before you mark the file to be
              part of the next commit.
              The local repository either does not have this file or has a older version. </li>
            <li> <strong>Staged</strong>. The file is not commited yet but it is marked to be commited in the next
              commit.</li>
            <li> <strong>Commited</strong>. Changes to the file were commited and the file is "up to date" on the local
              repository.
              The remote repository will not have these changes yet.</li>
            <li> <strong>Pushed</strong>. This means that you commited the changes to the remote repository, so the file
              is now "commited" on the remote repository too.
              Only changes that are commited on the local repository can be pushed. You can only push something if you
              your local repository has all the changes on the remote repository
              (otherwise you will need first to pull the changes from the remote repository).</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>2.4 Git commands for local repository</h4>
          <p> There are many commands you can use but we will focus only on the basic ones:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"git init"</strong> This creates a local repository. You will not need this command since "git
              clone" also creates a local repository
              that is a copy of the remote repository.</li>
            <li><strong>"git add . "</strong> Stages all files on the folder, including subfolders and their files. If
              you run this on the base folder
              of your project it will mark all files that were edited so that their changes are commited in the next
              commit.</li>
            <li><strong>"git commit"</strong> This will commit all changes, it will call the default editor for you to
              write a message describing the commit.
              <strong>All commits should have a description</strong>, the first line is a short description, the next
              lines describe in more details the changes made.
              If you have a short message to write you can add the message directly using <strong>git commit -m "Your
                message"</strong>.
              You can also change the default editor. The code bellow shows how to change to Notepad++ (default is Vim):
              <pre><code class="language-bash">git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"</code></pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>2.5 Git commands for remote repository</h4>
          <p> We will again focus on the basic commands</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>" git clone https://github.com/yourname/myproject"</strong> This was the command we already
              used.
              It makes a copy of the remote repository to your computer. The created folder will have a local repository
              with all the commited changes.
              It will also save information about where the code came from, called the "remote", allowing you to pull
              changes or to push changes (if you are the owner of the remote or have permitions for it).</li>
            <li><strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/myproject</strong>
              You will not need to use this since "clone" already adds the information about the remote repository where
              the code came from.
              If you have created the local repository directly, for instance by using "git init", you will need to run
              this command to
              add your remote repository and push changes to it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>git push</strong> This will push all your commits to the remote repository (the ones not already
              there).
              It will only work if you have a remote configured, if you commited changes and if your local repository is
              up to date with the remote one (otherwise you need to make a pull first).
              You can also say the name of the remote and the branch where you want to push, but we will assume that you
              only have one remote and one branch.
            </li>
            <li><strong>git pull</strong> This will pull all the changes on the remote repository to your local
              repository (the ones that were not already there).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>2.6 Conflicts</h4>
          <p>Consider the following example </p>
          <ol>
            <li> You made changes to the local repository </li>
            <li> Your colleague made changes to her/his local repository</li>
            <li> Your collegue pushed her/his changes to the remote repository</li>
            <li> You try to push yours and get an warning saying there are changes and that you need first to pull those
              changes</li>
            <li> You pull those changes to your computer</li>
          </ol>
          <p> Two things can occur when you pull the changes into your local repository where you already made some
            changes</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Git is able to merge both versions. This may be because changes were made in different files, or on
              different parts of the files.
              You can commit the merge to your local repository and than push the merged commit to the remote
              repository.
            </li>
            <li> Git finds a conflict between the two versions. Git will mark the conflict on those files by placing
              both versions of the changes~
              in the file with some aditional text to mark it. See an example bellow:
              <pre><code class="language-text">
              <<<<<<<<<< Head (Current Change)
                 Your code here
              ========
                 Your collaborator code here
              >>>>>>>>> Test (Incoming Change)
            </code></pre>
              You will need to edit the files with conflicts, choosing the correct code or creating a new code that
              correctly merges both.
              You also need to remove the added text. After that you can commit the merge and push. You have solved the
              conflict by manually making the merge.
          </ol>
        </section>
        <p> Enter the project folder that was created on the command line. </p>
        <p> Copy this file <a href="./files/gitignore">.gitignore</a> to your repository directory with the name
          ".gitignore" (make sure it has the dot in the beggining).
          The .gitignore file will tell git what files are not to be send to the repository. For instance the .env file
          will have sensitive
          information like our database password so we do not want it to be saved in the repository.</p>
        <p> You made changes to the repository so you need to run the commands to make the file go through all the
          necessary stages:
          Modified to Staged to Commited to Pushed. Run the following commands on the terminal inside your project
          folder:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
        git add .
        git commit -m "Added .gitignore for Node projects"
        git push
      </code></pre>
        <p> The push command will ask you to authenticate to your Github account. You only need to do this once, it will
          save the authentication for future interactions.</p>
        <p> You may need to use an access token instead of the Github password. It can be a little confusing so here are
          the steps for it:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Login to you github account.</li>
          <li> Click on the top left icon (profile icon) and choose "Settings"</li>
          <li> On Settings scroll down and choose "Developer Settings"</li>
          <li> Then choose "Personal access tokens" and then "Tokens (classic)"</li>
          <li> Click on the link "Generate a personal access token" </li>
          <li> Fill in the details:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Note</strong> Write a name to identify the token, for instance "git" </li>
              <li><strong>Select scopes</strong> Here you can define what the app can do with that token.
                Select "repo", that will allow git to access the repositories.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Scroll to the bottom and click "Generate token"</li>
          <li>Copy the token and paste it has a password (on some terminals you need to use right click to paste) to get
            access on git (Github username as username and the token as password)</li>
        </ol>
        <p> That is it, you made your first push and git now has credentials to access your github.
          You will not need to set the credentials again for that Github account, even for other projects/repositories.
        </p>
        <p>If you ever need to reset the credentials you need to open a terminal with administrator privelages and run
          this command:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">git config --system --unset credential.helper</code></pre>
        <p>Now to test making a pull request. On your Github account edit the text on README.md (Github as an editor for
          that in the page).
          Change the text there to something like "My first Node app".
        </p>
        <p>Run "git pull" on the terminal to get the changes made online. </p>
        <p>Usually you will get the changes made by other developers but for them to change your code you need to add
          them has colaborators</p>
        <p> <strong>To add collaborators to your project/repository </strong>
          go to Settings on your repository and then to Collaborators</p>
        <p> Write the username of who you want to add. He will need to go to his email and accept the invitation.
          After accepting the repository will show on his Github account, even though the path still has the creator
          username.
          He will also be able to make pushes and pulls of the repository as if he was the owner.
        </p>
        <p> That is it, if you want you can try making more pulls and pushes with a collegue to get used to using git
          and Github.</p>

      (click me to toggle text) </h3>
    <section id="creat_node">
      <h4 class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('node_about',false,'block')">About Node (click to toggle text)</h4>
      <section class="canHide" id="node_about">
        <h4>3N.1 What is Node?</h4>
        <p> Node.js was designed to build scalable network applications.
          Node.js focus on asynchronous and event base programming to prevent the main Node process from blocking or
          creating new threads.
        </p>
        <p> Basic example on how Node.js works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> A node server receives a request.</li>
          <li> An asynchronous function call is made to process the request.</li>
          <li> The node server main process is released to accept other requests.</li>
          <li> When the funcion call finishes processing the request the main process is called again to send the result
          </li>
          <li> If no other requests are made the server will "sleep"</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>3N.2 What are the main parts of Node?</h4>
        <p> Node.js has a binary core and javascript modules. It also has a repository of modules made by third party.
        </p>
        <p> Some of the core elements of Node.js</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>libuv</strong> It is an important part of the binary core and provides network and file services.
          </li>
          <li><strong>V8</strong> Googles Javascript engine. Runs all the javascript code of the core and 3d party
            modules.
            The code we will create will also use the javascript language. </li>
          <li><strong> http module</strong> One of the core modules, it allows us to create a server.
            Some functionalities of Node.js are immediatly available, for other functionalities, like the ones on the
            http module,
            we first need to import the correct module </li>
          <li><strong> 3rd party modules</strong> Node.js includes a powerful
            package manager called NPM (Node Package Module). 3rd party companies can create modules and submit to the
            NPM repository,
            making that module easilly available to every developer</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Node.js has tried to avoid some of the mistakes made for the Javascript language.
          One example is that each module has its own namespace (named entities like variables and functions are only
          known in their module).
        </p>
        <p>This encapsulation of the module avoids conflicts of names that trouble many javascript projects.
          Each module can then define what is exported to the exterior.
          Only exported variable/functions will be available when we import the module.</p>
        <h4>3N.3 Basic commands and concepts of Node and NPM</h4>
        <p>We will present the basic commands in the order they are usually needed to create a new project </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>npm init</strong> This command will create a package.json file that contains the settings of a
            Node.js project.
            It has a command line user interface that will ask the information for the file creation.
            You can run the command without it asking questions using <strong>npm init -y</strong> it will use default
            values. </li>
          <li><strong>package.json</strong> It is a text file in JSON format (you can edit the file using any text
            editor)
            that contains the main settigns of a node project. You can see bellow a basic example of the contents:
            <pre><code class="language-json">              {
                "name": "myproject",
                "version": "1.0.0",
                "private": true,
                "scripts": {
                  "start": "node app.js"
                },
                "dependencies": {
                  "cookie-parser": "~1.4.4",
                  "dotenv": "^16.0.0",
                  "express": "~4.16.1",
                  "mysql2": "8.7.3"
                }
              }</code></pre>
            <p>First you have the name and version of the project. Version numbers have meanings "major.minor.patch"
              a working project will have at least a 1 on major. Minor means that the changes to the main version do not
              change the functionalities, and patches are only corrections.
            </p>
            <p> With private to true NPM will refuse the project if someone tries to send it to the repository by
              mistake</p>
            <p> The scripts define commands that can be called using NPM. <strong>npm start</strong> will run the code
              defined for the start script</p>
            <p> The dependencies mark the modules needed for the project. Each time you install a module it will be
              added to the dependencies.
              Installed modules are not sent to the Github repository, but anyone that clones the repository only needs
              to run <strong>npm install</strong>
              and all the dependencies in the package.json will be installed. Symbols like ~ ^ can be used to control
              which version of the module can be installed
              (^ means it can install newer versions as long as they still have the same major version i.e. the same
              first number) </p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>npm install</strong> If you run this line without naming a module it will install all dependencies
            on package.json.
            To install a specific module you can do <strong> npm install mysql2 --save</strong> this will
            install the "mysql2" module and with the --save option will also save the dependency on package.json.</li>
          <li><strong>node app.js</strong> After we install all modules we can run our project by calling the main
            script using node.
            Notice this is the same command we used on the start script on package.json, so this would do the same as
            running
            <strong>npm start</strong>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Stoping the server</strong> When the server starts the terminal will be used as a console for
            logging information.
            To terminate the server you can press <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> on the terminal </li>

      <section class="canHide" id="express_about">
        <h4>3E.1 What is Express.js?</h4>
        <p> The express framework is a Node.js module that simplifies the creation of web applications.</p>
        <p> The main advantages of express consist on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A routing system</strong> This system associates an handler to a pair HTTP-method + Path.
            This allows developers to create clear APIs, like REST APIs, to request resources (we will learn more about
            REST later).</li>
          <li><strong>Middleware system</strong> An express application is essentially a series of middleware that form
            a pipeline
            to handle requests. The user request is passed through a series of middleware that will add or change the
            information until
            the response is calculated and sent back. The middleware can be from express itself, from 3rd party modules
            or created by us</li>
          <li><strong>Template engines</strong> These engines provide a way to create responses from templates</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The express framework gained many adepts that integrated it with other systems.
          For instance the MEAN Full-stack Web Developmen System includes Mongo-DB (database), Express(server),
          Angular(client) and Node (server enviroment).
        </p>
        <h4>3E.2 Main Express.js functionalities</h4>
        <p> To use express we must first install if using NPM: <strong>npm install express --save</strong></p>
        <p> After that we can import the express module and create our servers. A simple example bellow:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-js">          const express = require("express");
          const app = express();
          var path = require('path');
          app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
          app.get("/api/", function (req, res) {
              res.send("Hello World!");
          });
          
          app.listen(8888, function () {
              console.log("Server running at http://localhost:8888");
          });</code></pre>
        <p><strong>require</strong> will import the express module and path module (parses path strings).</p>
        <p><strong>express()</strong> will create an object with the settings for an Node/Express
          application. We can define new settings on that object, determining how the application will work.</p>
        <p><strong>app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));</strong>
          The public directory will now be used to look for static files (html, css, client javascript, images, etc)
          for our static web pages. __dirname is a global variable that nodes sets with the directory on where the
          project is,
          so by joining it with 'public' we mean the public folder inside our project directory.
        </p>
        <p><strong> app.get("/api/", function (req, res,next) {...}</strong>
          Defines a routing endpoint for the HTTP method <strong>get</strong> and path <strong>"/"</strong> and the
          defined handler.
          Handlers can receive 3 paramenters:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>req</strong> Request object. Has all the information that the client sent to be processed.
            Some middleware adds more information to this request, for instance a cookie middleware can parse the cookie
            and had the
            parsed information to the request.</li>
          <li><strong>res</strong> Result object. We will fill this object with the information we want to send to the
            user.
            The object also has function like "send", that allow us to send the information on the request object back
            to the client.</li>
          <li><strong>next</strong> This is a function that allows you to pass the control to the next middleware.
            When the handler is the last middleware to be called we do not need the next function and we can simple
            write
            <strong> app.get("/", function (req, res) {...}</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>app.listen(8888, function () {...});</strong>
          The server starts and will be listening to request in the port 8888, the function passed as
          second argument will be called when the server starts.
        </p>

    <h4 class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('servers_about',false,'block')"> How do servers work (click to toggle text)
    </h4>
    <section class="canHide" id="servers_about">
      <p> Consider a request of a website: </p>
      <p> <strong> http://www.mywebsite.pt:3000/folder1/mypage.html</strong></p>
      <p> The request will be composed of the following parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>http</strong> The protocol. Defines the rules on how the communication is made</li>
        <li><strong>www.mywebsite.pt</strong> The domain name. This will allow to identify what computer/server the
          request is for.
          To identify which computer to send the resquest the domain name must first be converted to an IP address
          (Internet Protocol Address).
          The Domain Name System, a group of hierarchically connect computers, saves the information of what IP address
          corresponds to each domain name.</li>
        <li><strong>:3000</strong> The port. The same computer may have many servers running but different server can
          listen to different ports.</li>
        <li><strong>/folder1/mypage.html</strong> The path. A server may provide different information and services, the
          path will define what service/information to provide.</li>
        <li>The method. The HTTP protocol defines different methods of sending requests: GET,PUT, POST, DELETE, PATCH...
          When you write an address on a browser the method will be GET, that means "get" the information of the web
          page
          or data you need.
          For the same path the server can define different functionalities depending on the method used. The GET method
          may return data, while for the POST method we can have data being saved in the server</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <p>Create the package.json file by running <strong>npm init -y</strong> on the terminal (inside your project
      directory). We will edit the file later</p>
    <p>Install the modules we will need. Run the following commands:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">
      npm install express --save
      npm install cookie-parser --save
      npm install dotenv --save
      npm install morgan --save
    </code></pre>
    <p> Besides the <strong>express</strong> module we are installing: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>cookie-parers</strong> Parses the information of cookies. Cookies stored in files in the client side,
        each time the client requests information
        to the server the information in the cookie is sent, thus allowing to have a state that is not stored in the
        server side. The cookie information is stored in two variables on the request object (req). <br>
        <strong>req.cookies</strong> stores an object with all cookie information that is not signed.<br>
        <strong>req.signedCookies</strong> stores an object with all cookie information that was signed.<br>
        To be able to process signed cookies we need to set a string that will be the "secret" for the signature.
      </li>
      <li><strong>dot-env</strong> Creates a set of environment variables from a ".env" file.
        The ".env" file is not stored on the git repository, so this is usefull to keep password or other information
        that we do not wish to disclose to the repository.
        For example, we can use it to store the secret for signed cookies.</li>
      <li><strong>morgan</strong> This module will log information about requests to the terminal console. It is useful
        for debugging.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Open the directory of the project with Visual Studio Code and then open the package.json file.
      You will see on the dependencies all the modules we installed.
    </p>
    <p> The node_modules directory was also created when you installed the modules. It will contain all installed
      modules.
      This directory will not be placed on the git repository. You can delete this directory at any time and just need
      to call
      <strong>npm install</strong> to create it again, since all dependencies are registered on the package.json file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Create a new file called <strong>index.js</strong> (this is the name of the main file in package.json) and write
      the code bellow:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">      require('dotenv').config();
      var express = require('express');
      var path = require('path');
      var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
      var morgan = require('morgan');
      
      var app = express();
      
      app.use(morgan('dev'));
      app.use(express.json());
      app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
      app.use(cookieParser(process.env.COOKIE_SECRET));
      app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
      const port = parseInt(process.env.port || '8080');
      app.listen(port,function() {
        console.log("Server running at http://localhost:"+port);
      });</code></pre>
    <p> You also need to create a <strong>.env</strong> file (yes, the file must start with a dot in the beggining)
      where we will save the cookie secret.
      The file should have the line bellow inside</p>
    <pre><code class="language-text">      COOKIE_SECRET=This is a secret</code></pre>
    <p> Most of this code was already explained but we can make a summary:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When running the command <strong> require('dotenv').config()</strong> we import all the enviroment variables
        in the <strong>.env</strong> file</li>
      <li> We import express module (require), create an express application (express()),
        configure the application (app.use(...)) and run the application (app.listen...).
        The port where the server runs can be changed by setting a PORT environment variable</li>
      <li>We set the morgan logger to print development information (prints for every request received)</li>
      <li>We configure the body parsers that come with express:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>express.json()</strong> Parses any json in the body of the request. The information will be stored
            in the request object as <strong>req.body</strong></li>
          <li><strong>express.urlencoded({ extended: false })</strong>
            Parses any urlencoded information in the body of the request.
            The information will be stored in the request object as <strong>req.body</strong></li>
        </ul>
        Body information can only be in one format so it will never overlap
      </li>
      <li>We configure the cookieParser with the secret that was stored in the .env file</li>
      <li>We defined the folder ('public') where our static files will be</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now click on the terminal menu and then on "New Terminal". A terminal console will open bellow the code and you
      can run your code using the command
      <strong>node index.js</strong>
    </p>
    <p> At this moment any request you make will result in a "Not Found" error (HTTP error code 404), since we have no
      files in the public diretories and no routing defined.</p>
    <p> Create a "public" folder in the project and a index.html file inside with the code bellow</p>
    <div id="public_index"></div>
    <script>loadHTMLTextInto("files/index.html","public_index");</script>
    <p>With an index.html file inside the public directory a page will open if you write "localhost:8080" on the browser.
      If no name is give the server will search for the "index.html" file.
    </p> 
    <p> This was an example of the Node.js/Express.js web pages server (static pages). Now lets make an example of the REST API Server part.</p>
    <p> The REST API will serve data, and to keep the code organized we will create two new folders</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create the <strong>routes</strong> folder. This folder will have code to receive requests, but will not make any calculations (no business logic).</li>
      <li>Create the <strong>models</strong> folder. This folder will have code to make all the needed calculations. When we have a database it will also be here we make the requests to the database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Create a <strong>usersRoutes.js</strong> file on the routes folder and 
    a <strong>usersModel.js</strong> file on the models folder.</p>
    <p> Write the following code on the <strong>usersModel.js</strong> file:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">  class User {
      constructor(id,name,email,password) {
          this.id = id;
          this.name = name;
          this.email = email;
          this.password = password;
      }
  }
  const users = [
      new User(1,"John","john@mail.com", "123"),
      new User(2,"Mary","mary@m.pt","abc"),
      new User(3,"Bob","bob@mail.pt","god")
  ];
  module.exports.getAll = async function getAll() {
      try {
          let result = [];
          for(let user of users ){
              result.push(new User(user.id,user.name,user.email));
          }
          return {status: 200, result: result};
      } catch (err) {
          console.log(err);
          return {status: 500, result: err };
      }
  }</code></pre>

  </h4>
  <section class="canHide" id="user_model">
    <h2>To Do</h2>
  </section>
  <p> Write the following code on the <strong>usersRoutes.js</strong> file:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-js">const express = require('express');
    const router = express.Router();
    const uModel = require("../models/usersModel");
    
    router.get('/', async function(req, res, next) {
        try { 
            console.log("Get all users");
            let result = await uModel.getAll();
            res.status(result.status).send(result.result);
        } catch(err) {
            console.log(err);
            res.status(500).send(err);
        }
      });
      
    module.exports = router;</code></pre>

  <h4 class="clickMe" onclick="showHide('user_routes',false,'block')"> usersRoutes.js code explanation (click to toggle text)
  </h4>
  <section class="canHide" id="user_routes">
    <h2>To Do</h2>
  </section>
  <p> The route file will use the model file, but no file is yet connected to the server. We must include the routes in the application as an handler to an endpoint.</p>
  <p> On the <strong>index.js</strong> file add the two lines bellow after the definition of the static files directory (and before the line that makes the server listen to the 8080 port):</p>
  <pre><code class="language-js">
  const usersRouter = require("./routes/usersRoutes");
  app.use("/api/users",usersRouter);
  </code></pre>
  <p> This will mean that to access any routes in the usersRoutes file we will need to write "/api/users" in the path. </p>
  <p> Notice that in the routes we also set a path, so the full path will be first the "/api/users" and then the path on the route</p>
  <p> Since we first set the static file directory and then the routes, if a path matches a static file the server will send the static file 
    and will not look at the routes.
    Only if no static file if found the routes are searched. That is why we placed the "/api/" for all the API routes. There will be no "api" 
    folder inside the public folder, so the static files will not hide any of the API routes.
